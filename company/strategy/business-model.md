# Business Model

## Core Principle: Traction First, Revenue Later

Middling is **not** focused on revenue initially. Like consumer B2C platforms, we build critical mass first, then convert traction into revenue.

## Legal Structure

**Public Benefit Corporation** (likely)

This structure allows us to:
- Prioritize social mission over profit maximization
- Maintain credibility as neutral civic platform
- Still raise capital and generate revenue when ready
- Avoid perception of political capture

## Funding Strategy

### Phase 1: Bootstrap
**Source**: Profits from Midstage Accelerator (founder's main business)

**Approach**:
- Launch as volunteer/non-profit project initially
- Self-funded development and operations
- No external fundraising pressure
- Freedom to experiment and find product-market fit

### Phase 2: Revenue (After Traction)
Once we have demonstrated user engagement and civic impact, multiple revenue streams become viable:

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Advocacy Organizations & Political Parties

**What they pay for**:
- **Data access** - Understand where consensus lies on issues
- **Contact access** - Recruit engaged citizens for their organizations
- **Proposal testing** - Run their ideas through citizen deliberation

**Revenue model**:
- Subscription or pay-per-report
- Tiered pricing based on data depth
- Contact recruitment fees

**Value proposition**:
- Real consensus data (not just polls)
- Access to civically engaged citizens
- Legitimacy from citizen-backed proposals

### 2. Politicians (Individual Elected Officials)

**What they pay for**:
- **Branded Middling site** with their name
- Platform to handle constituent requests constructively
- System to convert raw constituent complaints → refined, consensus-backed proposals
- Early visibility into emerging popular proposals

**Revenue model**:
- Monthly or annual subscription
- Tiered by jurisdiction size (local vs state vs national)

**Value proposition**:
- Offload constituent work to platform
- Look responsive and innovative
- Support proposals with built-in constituency
- Political advantage from early support

### 3. Labor Marketplace

**How it works**:
- Some citizens (especially younger ones) get **compensated** for deliberation work
- Work can be on behalf of advocacy organizations or politicians
- Middling facilitates and takes a fee

**Revenue model**:
- Platform fee (% of compensation)
- Similar to Upwork or Fiverr model

**Value proposition**:
- Citizens earn money for civic participation
- Organizations get quality deliberation
- Middling ensures quality and neutrality

### 4. Grants, Charity, Sponsorships

**Sources**:
- Foundations supporting democratic innovation
- Companies wanting to support civic engagement
- Wealthy individuals (civic-minded philanthropy)

**Structure**:
- Sponsor specific assemblies or communities
- "Supported by [Foundation Name]" branding
- **Critical guardrails**: Sponsors cannot influence debate content or outcomes

**Cultural sensitivity**:
- May not work in all countries (separation of money and politics)
- Must maintain neutrality and trust

## Citizens: Always Free (Potentially Compensated)

**Core principle**: Citizens never pay to participate

This is critical for:
- **Accessibility** - Civic participation should not have a paywall
- **Legitimacy** - Pay-to-play politics is the problem, not the solution
- **Trust** - Platform must be seen as neutral public good

**Inversion of social media model**:
- Social media: Users are the product (sold to advertisers)
- Middling: Users are paid participants (organizations pay for infrastructure and data)

## Unit Economics (TBD)

Will depend on:
- Cost to acquire users (CAC)
- Cost to serve users (hosting, AI costs)
- Average revenue per paying organization
- Conversion rate from free users to paid organizations

**Initial focus**: Minimize costs, maximize user value, worry about unit economics after product-market fit

## Path to Sustainability

### Milestone 1: Prove Engagement
- Launch Bullspin Detector (November 2025)
- Reach 250 users (December 2025)
- Validate viral mechanics work

### Milestone 2: Prove Deliberation
- Launch citizens assemblies
- Demonstrate consensus-building works
- Show proposals are higher quality after deliberation

### Milestone 3: Prove Impact
- Track proposals entering official political process
- Measure adoption rate by governments
- Document success stories

### Milestone 4: Prove Revenue Model
- Approach first advocacy organizations with data offering
- Sign first politician for branded platform
- Validate willingness to pay

### Milestone 5: Scale
- Expand to multiple jurisdictions
- Build sales/partnerships team
- Achieve sustainability without bootstrap funding

## Key Metrics

### Engagement Metrics (Free Platform)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Weekly Active Users (WAU)
- Proposals submitted per week
- Assemblies completed per month
- Consensus rate (% of assemblies reaching agreement)

### Impact Metrics (Social Value)
- **North Star**: % of proposals adopted by official political authorities
- Participant satisfaction with process
- Quality of proposals (before/after deliberation)
- Diversity of assembly participants

### Revenue Metrics (When Applicable)
- Organizations using platform (paid)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio

## What Success Looks Like

**Short-term (6 months)**:
- 250+ active users
- Bullspin Detector validated as viral hook
- First citizens assemblies completed successfully
- Proof that deliberation creates better proposals

**Medium-term (12-18 months)**:
- Thousands of active users
- Regular assembly activity across multiple communities
- First proposals adopted by local governments
- Revenue conversations with advocacy orgs and politicians

**Long-term (3-5 years)**:
- Tens of thousands of active participants
- Used in multiple jurisdictions/countries
- Measurable impact on civic engagement
- Self-sustaining revenue model
- Template for 21st century democracy
