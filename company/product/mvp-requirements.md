# MVP Requirements

## Launch Strategy: Staged MVPs

Middling will launch through a series of small MVPs, each building user base and engagement for more complex features.

### MVP 1: Bullspin Detector (November 2025)

**Core functionality**:
- User uploads any political proposal (text)
- AI analyzes and highlights:
  - Partisan language (highly partisan parts)
  - Neutral language
  - Nonsense/illogical arguments
- Returns visual analysis to user

**Purpose**:
- Viral hook to attract initial users
- Teaches constructive political thinking
- Builds user base for future features
- Low complexity, no critical mass needed

**Success metric**: 250 users by end of December 2025

### MVP 2: Political Spectrum Quiz (TBD)

**Core functionality**:
- Users answer questions
- AI places them on political spectrum
- Shareable results

**Purpose**:
- Additional viral hook
- Profile building for future assembly selection
- Low complexity, AI-powered

### MVP 3: Proposal Feed ("Tinder for Proposals") (TBD)

**Core functionality**:
- Browse proposals uploaded by other users
- Swipe-style like/dislike interface
- See AI-optimized versions alongside originals
- Notifications of new proposals

**Purpose**:
- Passive engagement
- Build preference data
- Keep users coming back
- Train users to evaluate proposals

**Engagement evolution**: Eventually move from voting to "voice your reasoning" for likes/dislikes

### MVP 4: Submit Your Proposal (TBD)

**Core functionality**:
- Upload your own proposal
- Request community feedback
- See who agrees/disagrees
- View AI suggestions for increasing consensus

**Purpose**:
- High-engagement entry point
- Generate proposal content for the feed
- Identify passionate users for assembly participation

### MVP 5: Citizens Assemblies on Demand (Future)

**Core functionality** (requires critical mass):
- User submits proposal and calls an assembly
- Pool of citizens indicate availability
- Selection algorithm filters for:
  - Neutrality (not directly aligned with topic)
  - Not experts or interested parties
  - Representativeness
- Assembly conducted with variable parameters:
  - Synchronous vs asynchronous (% mix)
  - Duration (days to weeks)
  - Schedule (daily, weekends, etc.)
  - Platform suggests random parameters to experiment
- Deliberation and consensus-building
- Final proposal output

**Purpose**:
- Core vision of DIY politics
- Real civic impact
- Proof that citizen deliberation works

## Must-Have Features (Across MVPs)

### For Users
- Simple, intuitive interfaces
- Fast AI response times
- Mobile-friendly
- Shareable results (viral mechanics)

### For Platform
- AI analysis engine (partisan detection, spectrum analysis, consensus optimization)
- User account system
- Proposal storage and retrieval
- Basic analytics

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Initially)

- **No voting on final policies** (that's for official governments)
- **No direct connection to elected officials** (comes later)
- **No complex assembly features** (until critical mass)
- **No monetization** (traction first)
- **No mobile apps** (web first)
- **No social features** (commenting, profiles, etc.) until needed

## Platform Philosophy

### Experimentation Over Perfection
- Platform experiments with assembly parameters
- Random/suggested variables (not just user choice)
- Learn what works through variation
- Embrace playful randomness

### Consensus Over Conflict
- Optimize for agreement, not engagement
- Highlight constructive language
- Teach reasoning over reactions
- Filter for neutral participants in assemblies

### Traction First
- Build user base before complex features
- Viral hooks before deep engagement
- Free for all citizens
- Revenue comes after proof of value

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Bullspin Detector)
- **Primary**: 250 users by end of December 2025
- Secondary: Viral coefficient (shares per user)
- Secondary: Return rate (how many come back)

### Phase 2 (Proposal Feed)
- **Primary**: Weekly active users
- Secondary: Proposals evaluated per user
- Secondary: Time spent on platform

### Phase 3 (Assemblies)
- **Primary**: Chance of reaching consensus
- **Ultimate North Star**: Chance of proposal being adopted by official political authorities
- Secondary: Assembly completion rate
- Secondary: Participant satisfaction

## Key Dependencies

### Technical
- AI models for text analysis (partisan detection, consensus optimization)
- Selection algorithms (filter for neutrality, representativeness)
- Parameter suggestion algorithms (assembly format optimization)

### User Base
- Minimum viable assembly size (TBD, but likely 7-15 people)
- Enough diversity for representative selection
- Engaged citizens willing to deliberate (not just vote)

### Strategy
- Viral mechanics that convert casual users to engaged participants
- Clear value proposition at each stage
- Path from simple (Bullspin) to complex (Assemblies)
