# Middling Company Foundation

This directory contains the core knowledge about Middling Company that all agents need to operate effectively.

**Last Updated**: November 2025 (by Company Foundation Agent)

## Quick Reference

### What We Do
**Middling is DIY politics through citizens assemblies on demand** - like jury duty for civic problems.

### Who We Serve
**"Armchair Politicians"** - civically engaged people disillusioned with current political dysfunction.

### How We Make Money
Traction first, then revenue from politicians (branded platforms) and advocacy orgs (data/contacts). Citizens always free.

### Timeline
- **November 2025**: Launch Bullspin Detector
- **December 2025**: Reach 250 users
- **2026**: Build toward citizens assemblies

## For Agents

### Before Creating Issues
Read `vision.md` and `product/mvp-requirements.md` to understand what we're building and why.

### Before Prioritizing Work
Check `product/roadmap.md` to understand current phase and priorities.

### Before Making Product Decisions
Align with core philosophy:
- **Experimentation over perfection**
- **Consensus over conflict**
- **Traction first**
- **Citizens always free**

### When Uncertain
Ask yourself:
1. Does this help people feel more empowered in democracy?
2. Does this optimize for consensus (not just engagement)?
3. Does this fit our current phase of the roadmap?
4. Would an "armchair politician" find this valuable?

## Updating This Foundation

The Company Foundation Agent should be re-run when:
- Major pivot in strategy
- New target market identified
- Significant product changes
- Quarterly foundation audit (best practice)
- Frequent agent conflicts (signals unclear foundation)

To re-run: Use the `company-foundation-interviewer` agent in `/agents/definitions/foundation/`

## Key Principles

1. **Democracy is the engine of societal evolution** - This is why we exist
2. **21st century problems need 21st century solutions** - Political structures must evolve
3. **Deliberation > Voting** - We're building consensus tools, not polling tools
4. **Randomness as feature** - Embrace experimentation with assembly formats
5. **Neutral participants = better outcomes** - Filter for lack of bias, not expertise
6. **Citizens are paid participants, not the product** - Invert social media model
