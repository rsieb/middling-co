# Middling Company Vision

## The Problem

**Democracy is failing to represent people in the 21st century.**

People feel:
- **Disillusioned** - they don't feel represented by current political systems
- **Powerless** - unable to influence politics or policy decisions
- **Disgusted** - by shouting matches instead of constructive solution-finding
- **Distrustful** - of corruption and "capture" of political systems by special interests

Meanwhile, **politicians are overwhelmed** - constituents expect them to solve every problem, but politicians' actual role is to vote on proposals, not do all the work of problem analysis, stakeholder coordination, and consensus-building.

**Root cause**: Political participation structures haven't evolved since the 18th century, despite massive societal changes.

## Who We Serve

### Primary: "Armchair Politicians"
Citizens who are:
- Highly interested in politics and societal problems
- Skilled at reaching consensus in their own organizations (schools, workplaces, civic groups)
- Disillusioned with dysfunctional politics at local, state, or national level
- Care deeply about better solutions but would never join the current political system
- Likely skew younger (but not exclusively)

### Secondary: Politicians & Advocacy Organizations
- **Politicians**: Need a way to handle constituent requests constructively
- **Advocacy organizations**: Want to understand where consensus lies and recruit engaged citizens
- **Political parties**: Seek data on public opinion and emerging issues

## Our Solution

**Middling is DIY politics through citizens assemblies on demand.**

Like jury duty for civic problems - people participate in politics the way they participate in the judicial system:

**For Citizens**:
- **Get invited** to serve on citizens assemblies/juries for societal problems (like jury duty)
- **Call assemblies on-demand** - anyone can submit a proposal and convene a citizens assembly to review it
- **Deliberate, don't just vote** - participate in actual debate as part of the jury/assembly
- **Feel empowered** - propose ideas and get instant peer feedback
- **Feel represented** - regularly called to evaluate others' proposals

**For Politicians**:
- Offload constituent requests to the platform
- Receive refined, consensus-built proposals instead of raw complaints
- Support popular proposals early for political advantage
- Use branded Middling site for constituent engagement

**For Advocacy Organizations**:
- Access consensus data to understand society's position
- Run their own proposals through citizen deliberation
- Recruit engaged citizens for their causes

## Why We'll Win

**Unique positioning**:

1. **Outsider perspective** - Not involved in politics, so we can see the skewed incentives that prevent insiders from fixing the system

2. **Comparative systems thinking** - Lived in multiple countries (US, Netherlands, others), so we don't take any political system for granted. We understand democratic structures are designed incentive systems, not absolute truths.

3. **Facilitation expertise** - 10+ years helping startup leadership teams navigate difficult problems and reach consensus. We know how to bring groups to consensus, not just "let all voices be heard" (which created social media dysfunction).

4. **Tech + disruption experience** - Deep Silicon Valley experience. We know past civic tech failed because they tried to sell incrementally to local governments. We're building a disruptive platform, not partnering with incumbents.

5. **Democratic process laboratory** - We're not digitizing one political system. We're creating a platform that experiments with different democratic incentive structures to learn what works best.

## Why This Matters

**Democracy is humanity's engine for societal evolution.**

It's the only system that:
- Allows multiple opinions to coexist
- Enables truth-seeking through collective deliberation
- Allows societies to learn from each other and admit when wrong
- Evolves continuously rather than growing stale

The alternative (dictatorships, authoritarian systems):
- Dependent on one strongman's will
- Grow stale over time
- Decrease effectiveness, wealth, and overall happiness

**The stakes**: If we don't fix civic participation, democracy continues declining and we risk losing the only system that drives societies forward through continuous learning and evolution.

Democracy isn't just worthy of preservation for its own sake - **it's the engine of progress**.

## Long-term Vision

**In 3-5 years**: People experience politics as participatory and empowering
- Regular invitations to serve on citizens assemblies (like jury duty)
- Default to finding solutions instead of shouting matches
- On-demand assemblies for any community problem
- Politicians freed to govern instead of doing constituent pre-work
- Visible proof that citizen deliberation leads to better policy

**The world changes when**:
- Civic engagement feels meaningful, not futile
- Political discourse defaults to consensus-building, not conflict
- Democracy evolves to fit 21st century society
- Other countries adopt similar participatory structures

## Core Philosophy

**Embrace randomness and experimentation.**

Traditional democracy defaults to: "Let's vote on everything (including how we vote)"

Middling defaults to: **"Let's experiment with random parameters and learn what works"**

- Platform suggests/assigns random assembly parameters (duration, sync/async, format)
- Creates natural variation across jurisdictions to learn from
- Randomness as playful/fair element - embracing experimentation
- Historical precedent: Sortition (random selection) as the "Will of God"
- **Core community value**: Experimentation over rigid process

**Middling is a learning system for democracy, not a fixed platform.**
