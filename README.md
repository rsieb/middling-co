## What is This?

This repository contains the **complete business operations** of Middling Company, an AI-native startup building the [Middling app](https://github.com/yourusername/middling-app) (coaching marketplace for mid-career professionals).

**The Experiment**: Can AI agents run an entire company with just one human founder?

**The Goal**: Achieve 10,000:1 users-per-employee ratio through intelligent agent coordination.

---

## Why Does This Exist?

### Problem
Everyone talks about "AI-native companies" but few show how they actually work. It's all theory, no practice.

### Solution
This repo is a **working template** for AI-native operations:
- All business functions handled by specialized AI agents
- Agent coordination through GitHub infrastructure
- Human-in-the-loop progressing to autonomous operations
- Full transparency: metrics, decisions, learnings

### Who Should Care?
- **Startup founders** exploring AI-driven efficiency
- **Consultants** advising on AI transformation
- **Researchers** studying AI organizational structures
- **Developers** building autonomous agent systems

---

## How It Works

### Agent-Driven Operations

**15+ specialized agents** handle all business functions:
- **CEO Agent** → Strategic decisions, prioritization
- **Product Manager Agent** → Roadmap, requirements
- **Engineering Manager Agent** → Sprint planning, technical coordination
- **Marketing Agent** → Content, campaigns, SEO
- **Support Agent** → Customer inquiries, bug triage
- **CFO Agent** → Budget, runway, metrics
- [See full agent list →](/agents/definitions/)

### Coordination via GitHub
Agents coordinate through native GitHub features:
- **Issues** = Tasks and work items
- **Pull Requests** = Proposed changes
- **Discussions** = Strategic debates
- **Project Board** = Kanban workflow
- **Wiki** = Knowledge base
- **Actions** = Automation

### Human Oversight
**Phase 1 (Current)**: Human approves all major decisions
**Phase 2 (3-6mo)**: Agents handle routine operations autonomously
**Phase 3 (6-12mo)**: Human focuses only on strategy and exceptions

---

## Current Status

| Metric | Current | Target (6mo) | Target (12mo) |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Active Users** | 0 | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| **Human Employees** | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Users/Employee** | 0:1 | 1,000:1 | 10,000:1 |
| **Monthly Cost** | $0 | $500 | $1,000 |
| **Agent Autonomy** | 0% | 80% | 90% |

**Current Phase**: Foundation - Setting up agent infrastructure

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just marketing for your consulting?**
A: Yes, AND it's a real company building a real product with real users. Both are true.

**Q: How much time do you spend on this?**
A: ~10 hours/week as the human founder. The goal is to reduce this to ~2 hours/week.

**Q: What if agents make bad decisions?**
A: Human approval required initially. As agents prove reliability, autonomy increases. All decisions logged.

**Q: Can I copy this for my company?**
A: Absolutely. That's the point. Fork the structure, adapt the agents, run your own experiment.

**Q: Where's the actual app code?**
A: Separate repo: [middling-app](https://github.com/yourusername/middling-app). This repo is business operations only.

**Q: How do you prevent agent chaos?**
A: Clear role definitions, approval workflows, human oversight, and coordination protocols. [See details →](/agents/workflows/)

**Q: Is the Middling app free?**
A: Public benefit model. Target: $5/user/year, free for those who can't afford it.

**Q: Are you hiring?**
A: Not humans. But we're always initializing new agents. Want to design one? Open a Discussion.
