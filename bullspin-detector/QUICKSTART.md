# Bullspin Detector - Quick Start Guide

**Goal**: Run your first agent-driven Reddit growth experiment in 30 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.11+
2. API key (OpenRouter or OpenAI)
3. Jupyter Notebook or Python environment

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/user/middling-co/bullspin-detector/agentic

# Install
pip install pyautogen python-dotenv jupyter
```

---

## Step 2: Configure API Key (2 minutes)

```bash
# Copy from main autogen setup
cp ../../autogen-agents/.env .env

# OR create new .env
echo "MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter" > .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
echo "DEFAULT_MODEL=qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct" >> .env
```

---

## Step 3: Open Notebook (1 minute)

```bash
jupyter notebook bullspin_mvp.ipynb
```

**OR use VS Code** with Jupyter extension

---

## Step 4: Run Scenario 1 - Research (10 minutes)

**In the notebook**:

1. Run "Setup" cells
2. Run "Create Agents" cells
3. Run "Create Group Chat" cells
4. Edit "Scenario 1" cell to add current political topics:
   ```python
   Current events to consider:
   - "Trump tariff proposals"  # ← Change this
   - "Immigration policy debate"  # ← Change this
   ```
5. Run "Scenario 1" cell
6. **Watch agents find Reddit threads!**
7. Run "Export Log" cell

**You should see**:
- Supervisor delegates to Research Agent
- Research Agent finds 3-5 threads
- Supervisor prioritizes
- Full conversation exported to `/logs/`

---

## Step 5: Review Results (5 minutes)

**Check the logs**:
```bash
ls logs/
cat logs/scenario-1-research-*.md
```

**Ask yourself**:
- Did Research Agent find good threads?
- Was the conversation natural?
- Where would a human add value?

---

## Step 6: Run Scenario 2 - Writing (10 minutes)

**In the notebook**:

1. Copy best 1-2 thread URLs from Scenario 1
2. Paste into "Scenario 2" cell:
   ```python
   [PASTE SELECTED THREADS FROM SCENARIO 1]
   # Example:
   # Thread 1: r/AskPolitics - "How do I fact-check political claims?"
   # Thread 2: r/politics - "Trump tariff proposals explained"
   ```
3. Run "Scenario 2" cell
4. **Watch agents draft comments!**
5. Run "Export Log" cell

**You should see**:
- Writer Agent drafts comments
- Tracker Agent creates trackable links
- Supervisor coordinates

---

## Step 7: Human Review (5 minutes)

**Review the drafts**:
```bash
cat logs/scenario-2-writing-*.md
```

**Ask yourself**:
- Do comments sound natural?
- Are they too promotional?
- Would you actually post this?

**Edit if needed** before posting!

---

## Step 8: (Optional) Post to Reddit

⚠️ **Manual step** - agents don't actually post

1. Copy comment draft you like
2. Edit for your voice
3. Post manually to Reddit
4. Note which trackable link you used

---

## Step 9: (Optional) Track Results

**After posting**, run Scenario 3:

1. Wait 24-48 hours for clicks/signups
2. Check analytics (manual for now)
3. Run "Scenario 3" cell in notebook
4. Agents will report results (you'll need to feed them data)

---

## What You've Learned

After running these scenarios, you now have:

✅ **Real conversation logs** showing agent coordination
✅ **Comment drafts** generated by AI
✅ **Experience** with human-in-loop workflow
✅ **Material** for Copenhagen presentation

**Next steps**:
1. Document learnings in `/learnings/week1-bullspin.md`
2. Populate MARP slides with real examples
3. Practice presentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'"
```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

### "API key not found"
```bash
# Make sure .env exists
ls -la .env

# Check it has your key
cat .env | grep API_KEY
```

### "Agents not responding"
- Check API key is valid
- Check you have credits
- Try cheaper model (gpt-3.5-turbo if using OpenAI)

### "Conversation loops forever"
- Ctrl+C to stop
- Adjust max_round in config
- Add more specific instructions

## Cost Estimate

**With Qwen 2.5 (OpenRouter)**:
- Scenario 1: ~$0.002
- Scenario 2: ~$0.005
- Scenario 3: ~$0.002
- **Total**: ~$0.01 for entire experiment

**With GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)**:
- Scenario 1: ~$0.50
- Scenario 2: ~$1.00
- Scenario 3: ~$0.50
- **Total**: ~$2 for entire experiment

**Both totally affordable!**

---

## Next Level

**Want to go deeper?**

1. **Run multiple cycles** (different topics, different days)
2. **A/B test** agent-drafted vs human-drafted comments
3. **Track conversion** (which threads/comments work best?)
4. **Customize agents** (edit system messages in `bullspin_agents.py`)
5. **Add new agents** (Analytics Agent, Engagement Agent, etc)
