**Option 2 - Relatable**:
> I got tired of trying to figure out if politicians were lying, so I started using Bullspin Detector. It's basically a BS detector for political proposals.

**Option 3 - Solution-focused**:

## Medium Version (3-4 sentences)

**Option 1 - Problem/Solution**:
> I've had the same frustration - it's so hard to know what's actually in these proposals vs what's just spin. I started using this tool called Bullspin Detector that helps cut through the BS. It pulls actual bill text and compares it to political claims. Might be useful if you're trying to fact-check other proposals too.

**Option 2 - Personal Experience**:
> I was getting overwhelmed trying to fact-check everything manually. Someone recommended Bullspin Detector and it's been super helpful. It shows you the actual proposal text next to the political claims so you can see the difference. Not perfect, but saves a ton of time.

**Option 3 - Empathetic**:
> Yeah, this is exactly why I started looking for tools to help with this. Found Bullspin Detector which does a decent job at comparing what politicians say vs what's actually in the proposals. It's not going to solve everything, but it helps you spot the obvious BS pretty quickly.

## Long Version (5+ sentences)

**Option 1 - Detailed**:
> I've been frustrated by this too - it feels like you need a law degree to understand what's actually being proposed. I started using this tool called Bullspin Detector that helps fact-check political proposals. It works by pulling the actual bill text and comparing it to what politicians are claiming publicly. For example, when [specific current proposal] was announced, the claims were [X] but the bill actually said [Y]. It's not perfect (no automated tool is), but it's helped me cut through the BS way faster than trying to read hundreds of pages myself. Might be worth checking out if you're trying to fact-check other proposals.

**Option 2 - Conversational**:
> Same here! I got so tired of seeing wildly different interpretations of the same proposal. Someone on here actually recommended Bullspin Detector a while back and I've been using it since. Basically it pulls the actual legislative text and shows it side-by-side with political claims. The cool part is it highlights specific sections where the claim doesn't match the text. Not going to lie, it's still a lot of reading, but at least you know you're looking at the source material not just someone's spin on it. Has been pretty helpful for me when trying to understand what's actually being proposed vs what's being sold.

### For policy debate threads:
> Just to add some data here - I ran this through Bullspin Detector and the actual proposal says [specific finding]. Doesn't settle the debate but worth knowing what the text actually says vs what's being claimed. [link]

### For "explain this policy" threads:
> I was confused about this too. Used Bullspin Detector to pull the actual language from the bill - turns out [specific insight]. The claims being made are [accurate/misleading] based on the text. Here's what I found: [link]

### For partisan argument threads (be careful!):
> Setting aside the partisan stuff for a sec - Bullspin Detector shows the actual bill text says [X]. Both sides are spinning it their way, but that's what's actually written. Make of it what you will. [link]

## When to Avoid Posting

**Red flags** (don't engage):
- Thread is pure partisan fighting (you'll get downvoted)
- Subreddit has strict self-promotion rules
- Topic is off-base (not about proposals/fact-checking)
- Thread is old/dead (no one will see it)
- You're the only one talking about the tool (spam signal)

**Better to skip than get banned!**
