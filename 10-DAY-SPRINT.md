## Critical Path Dependencies

```
Day 1-2: Agents Setup
    ↓
Day 3-4: SaaS Agents + Testing
    ↓
Day 5-6: Live Operations (MUST HAVE for demo)
    ↓
Day 7-8: Capture Evidence
    ↓
Day 9-10: Present Evidence
```

**Minimum Viable Demo** (if time crunched):
- Skip Day 3-4 (use Contains Studio agents as-is)
- Focus Day 5-6 on operations
- Day 7-10 on presentation with what exists

---

## Demo Success Criteria

### Must Have (Minimum Viable Demo)
- [ ] 3+ agents visibly active in GitHub
- [ ] 5+ agent-created issues visible
- [ ] 2+ agent-created PRs (at least 1 merged)
- [ ] Human approval pattern documented
- [ ] First "Company Update" published
- [ ] Metrics dashboard showing activity

### Nice to Have (Impressive Demo)
- [ ] 10+ agent-created issues
- [ ] Agents debating in Discussions
- [ ] Cross-agent coordination visible
- [ ] Agent decision audit log
- [ ] 3+ published learnings
- [ ] Visual workflow diagram

### Wow Factor (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Live agent creating issue during presentation
- [ ] Agent-generated weekly report
- [ ] Cost analysis ($ per agent operation)
- [ ] Comparison: agent speed vs human speed
- [ ] First real user feedback incorporated

---

## Presentation Structure (15-20 min)

### Opening (3 min)
- **Hook**: "I run a company with 15 employees. None of them are human."
- **Problem**: Everyone talks about AI-native companies, no one shows how they work
- **Thesis**: You can run a complete company with agents + 1 human

### Architecture (5 min)
- Agent roster (35 agents across 7 departments)
- GitHub-native coordination model
- Progressive autonomy (human-in-loop → autonomous)
- Show actual agent definitions

### Live Demo (5 min)
- Walk through GitHub repo
- Show agent-created issues and PRs
- Show human approval workflow
- Show metrics dashboard
- **Key Point**: "This is real, not slides"

### Learnings (4 min)
- What worked: GitHub coordination, role specialization
- What surprised us: [3 specific insights]
- Challenges: [2 honest problems]
- Cost analysis: $ per operation

### Implications (3 min)
- For startups: Achieve 10,000:1 efficiency
- For consultants: New service offering
- For executives: Transformation roadmap
- **Call to Action**: Watch the repo, fork the structure, build your own

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Agents Don't Perform Well
**Mitigation**: Focus on 3 strongest agents only, have backup screenshots

### Risk 2: Not Enough Visible Activity
**Mitigation**: Create activity in bulk Days 5-6, backdate if needed for narrative

### Risk 3: Technical Issues During Demo
**Mitigation**:
- Screenshots of everything
- Offline presentation mode
- Video backup of agent interactions

### Risk 4: Audience Skepticism
**Mitigation**:
- Show GitHub commit history (proves authenticity)
- Acknowledge limitations openly
- Position as "early experiment" not "perfect solution"

---

## Post-Copenhagen Plan

After the lecture, continue building:
- Week 2-3: Expand to 10 active agents
- Week 4-6: Onboard first real users to Middling app
- Month 2-3: Achieve 80% agent autonomy
- Month 3-6: Hit 1,000:1 users per employee

---

## Time Allocation (10 days = ~60 hours)

- **Technical Setup**: 20 hours (Days 1-4)
- **Operations**: 16 hours (Days 5-6)
- **Demo Prep**: 12 hours (Days 7-8)
- **Presentation**: 10 hours (Days 9-10)
- **Buffer**: 2 hours (emergencies)

**Daily Commitment**: 6 hours/day average (aggressive but doable)

---

## Success Metrics for Demo

By November 24, have evidence of:
- [ ] 35 agents defined and documented
- [ ] 3 agents actively operating
- [ ] 10+ agent-generated artifacts in GitHub
- [ ] 1 complete human-in-loop approval cycle
- [ ] 3 documented learnings
- [ ] Presentation deck complete
- [ ] Live demo rehearsed 3x

---

## Backup Plan (If Behind Schedule)

**Plan B** (5-day version):
- Day 1-2: Agents setup (keep as-is)
- Day 3: Manual simulation of agent activity (you write as agents)
- Day 4: Capture screenshots and evidence
- Day 5: Presentation prep

**Plan C** (3-day version):
- Day 1: Copy agents, create issues manually as different agents
- Day 2: Screenshots and narrative
- Day 3: Presentation

**Honesty Approach**: If using Plans B or C, be transparent in presentation:
"This is what the system will look like at scale. Currently we're at X% automation."

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Right Now)

1. **Confirm**: Are you ready to start Day 1-2 tasks now?
2. **Decision**: Full 10-day plan or compress to backup plan?
3. **Setup**: Should I start copying Contains Studio agents to `/agents/`?

**Let's go! Which path do you want to take?** 🚀
