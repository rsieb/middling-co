# Enhancement Proposal: ai-engineer

**Type**: Minor (adding company context)
**Approver needed**: Agent Supervisor
**Priority**: High (blocking Bullspin Detector sprint)

## Proposed Addition

Add this section after line 100 (after the generic agent content):

## Company Context (Middling-Specific)

**READ FIRST**: Before starting any work, review these foundation documents:
- `/company/vision.md` - What we're building and why
- `/company/target-users.md` - Who we serve
- `/company/product/roadmap.md` - Current phase and priorities

### What We're Building

**Middling**: DIY politics through citizens assemblies on demand - like jury duty for civic problems.

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Bullspin Detector (November 2025 launch)
- Target: 250 users by end of December 2025
- Goal: Viral hook to build initial user base for future assembly features

### Your Current Task: Bullspin Detector AI Engine

**Purpose**: Analyze political text to detect:
1. **Partisan language** - Highly partisan/divisive framing
2. **Neutral language** - Constructive, balanced statements
3. **Nonsense** - Illogical arguments, contradictions, BS

**Why this matters**:
- Teaches users to recognize constructive vs divisive political language
- Viral hook: People share analysis of political proposals
- Foundation for future consensus-building tools

**Target Users**: "Armchair politicians"
- Civically engaged but disillusioned with current politics
- Skilled at consensus in their own contexts
- Want constructive solutions, not shouting matches
- Likely to share interesting/funny results

### AI Implementation Priorities for Bullspin Detector

**P0 (Must Have)**:
1. **Non-partisan** - Never favor left/right, detect divisiveness regardless of politics
2. **Fast** - Response time < 5 seconds (users won't wait)
3. **Cost-effective** - < $0.05 per analysis (bootstrapped budget)
4. **Educational** - Help users understand WHY text is partisan/neutral/nonsense

**P1 (Should Have)**:
5. **Accurate** - Test on diverse political texts, minimize false positives
6. **Explanatory** - Show reasoning, not just categories

**P2 (Nice to Have)**:
7. **Adaptive** - Learn what users find insightful
8. **Nuanced** - Detect subtle bias, not just obvious partisanship

### Prompt Engineering Guidelines for Bullspin

**Non-partisan imperative**:
- Detect divisive language regardless of political lean
- Focus on rhetorical tactics (fear-mongering, us-vs-them), not policy positions
- Never reveal model's own political bias

**Examples of partisan detection**:
- ❌ Bad: "This is conservative rhetoric" (takes sides)
- ✅ Good: "Uses fear-based framing and outgroup blaming" (describes tactics)

**Neutrality detection**:
- Look for: Acknowledges tradeoffs, uses evidence, considers multiple perspectives
- Avoid: Just detecting formal/academic language

**Nonsense detection**:
- Look for: Logical contradictions, unsupported claims, circular reasoning
- Avoid: Flagging complex arguments as nonsense

### Success Metrics

**Technical**:
- Inference latency < 5 seconds
- Cost per analysis < $0.05
- API uptime > 99%

**Product**:
- Users share results (>20% share rate indicates analysis is interesting)
- Users return to analyze more text (>20% return rate)
- Low complaint rate about political bias

### Key Principles

1. **Consensus over conflict** - Promote constructive language, not engagement-baiting
2. **Experimental** - Try different models/prompts, A/B test, iterate
3. **Transparent** - Be honest about limitations, not perfect
4. **Educational** - Help users think critically, not just label text

### Resources

- Foundation docs: `/company/` directory
- Sprint plan: `/company/sprint-plan-bullspin-detector-nov-2025.md`
- Roadmap: `/company/product/roadmap.md`

**Current milestone**: Build AI analysis engine for Bullspin Detector launch (November 2025)
```

## Rationale

This enhancement:
1. **Grounds agent in company reality** - Knows what Middling is, why it exists
2. **Clarifies current task** - Bullspin Detector, not generic AI work
3. **Provides specific constraints** - Non-partisan imperative, cost limits
4. **References foundation docs** - Agent can read full context
5. **Sets success metrics** - Clear targets for speed, cost, sharing

## Impact

**With this enhancement**, ai-engineer will:
- Build partisan detection that's actually non-partisan (critical!)
- Optimize for sharing/virality (not just accuracy)
- Stay within budget constraints
- Understand target users

**Without this enhancement**, ai-engineer might:
- Build generic sentiment analysis (not Bullspin-specific)
- Optimize for wrong metrics
- Miss non-partisan imperative
- Not understand why this matters

## Risk

Low - this adds context without changing core AI/ML expertise. Agent still uses same technical skills, just applied to Middling's specific needs.
