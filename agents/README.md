# Middling Company Agents

**Status**: Day 1 - Messy deployment, figuring it out as we go

**Reality Check**: We just copied 35+ agents from a template and deployed them all at once. Just like hiring 35 people on day one. Let's see what happens.

---

## What We're Learning (Updated Daily)

### Day 1 - November 14, 2025
**What we did**: Copied all agents from Contains Studio template

**Expectations**:
- Agents will coordinate smoothly through GitHub
- Roles will be clear
- Operations will be automated

**Reality** (TBD):
- [To be documented as chaos unfolds]

**Next**: Let agents start creating issues and see what breaks

---

## Known Issues (Honest List)

- [ ] No clear decision hierarchy among agents
- [ ] Multiple agents probably overlap in responsibilities
- [ ] Haven't tested if agents can actually coordinate
- [ ] Copied from agency model, not SaaS model
- [ ] Don't know which agents we'll actually need
- [ ] No workflows defined yet

**Philosophy**: We'll fix these as we encounter them, not preemptively.

## Modification Log

### Agents We'll Need to Adapt
- Product agents → Add SaaS metrics focus (MRR, churn, LTV)
- Marketing agents → Shift from viral focus to product-led growth
- Finance agent → Add subscription revenue modeling

### Agents We Might Not Use
- Instagram curator (low priority for B2B coaching marketplace)
- Reddit community builder (defer to post-launch)
- TikTok strategist (maybe later)

### Agents We Need to Create
- customer-success-agent (critical for SaaS)
- subscription-optimizer-agent (need this soon)
- plg-specialist-agent (product-led growth focus)
- retention-specialist-agent (churn prevention)
- onboarding-optimizer-agent (user activation)

**Status**: None created yet. Prioritizing working with what we have first.

---

## Coordination Model (Theory)

**How agents should coordinate**:
- Issues = Work items (agents create and claim)
- Pull Requests = Proposed changes
- Discussions = Strategic debates
- Project Board = Kanban workflow
- Labels = Routing (agent:name)

**Reality**: We'll see if this actually works in practice.

---

## Human Oversight (Me)

**Current Role**: Approve everything

**Goal**: Gradually reduce to strategic decisions only

**Bottleneck Risk**: Yes, I know. We'll optimize as we learn.

---

## For Observers

**What to Watch**:
- Which agents actually get used vs sit idle
- Conflicts between agents
- How coordination patterns emerge (or don't)
- Human approval bottlenecks

**Follow Along**: Watch GitHub activity for real-time agent operations

**Be Honest**: If you see obvious problems, open an issue. We're learning.

*This is an experiment. We're building in public. Expect mess, iteration, and honest documentation of what actually happens.*
