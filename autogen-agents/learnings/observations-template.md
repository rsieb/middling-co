- [ ] Too much debate (unproductive)

**Example interactions**:
```
[Paste 1-2 interesting exchanges between agents]
```

- [ ] Yes, clear decision made
- [ ] Partial, some things decided
- [ ] No, conversation was inconclusive

## Emergent Insights

**What surprised you?**
[Unexpected behaviors or outcomes]

**What worked well?**
[Positive observations]

**What didn't work?**
[Problems or inefficiencies]

**Patterns to watch for in future scenarios:**
[Things to track across multiple runs]

## Cost Analysis

**Estimated tokens used**: ~X,XXX
**Estimated cost**: $X.XX
**Cost per round**: $X.XX

**Was this efficient?**
- [ ] Yes, conversation was focused
- [ ] No, too much back-and-forth
- [ ] Could have been done cheaper/faster

---

## Human Intervention

**Did you need to intervene?**

## Comparison to Human Approach

**If you handled this yourself (no agents), what would have been different?**

**Speed**: Faster / Slower / Same
**Quality**: Better / Worse / Same
**Cost**: Cheaper / More expensive / Same

**Key differences**:
[How does agent collaboration differ from human work?]

---

## Publication Potential

**Could this be a blog post / case study?**
- [ ] Yes, very interesting findings
- [ ] Maybe, with more data
- [ ] No, routine observation

**Angle if yes**:
[What's the story/insight to share?]

---

## Next Experiments

**Based on this observation, what should we test next?**
[Ideas for future scenarios or variations]
